## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that the Docker image still builds, and properly
   launches.  This usually fails, for example, if you include new
   Perl dependencies but forget to add them to the Dockerfile.

2. If you are changing the nature of the Vault of Cardboard Query
   Language, make sure that the README.md is updated, as well as
   the in-site documentation.  These two documents should match.

3. After review and approval, your Pull Request will be merged by
   a repository owner.
